# minecraft-dynmap-to-rpgregions
Convert Dynmap regions to WorldGuard/RPGRegions

Place these files in plugins/RPGRegions, update `worldName` to your world's name in translateRegions.py and finally run translateRegions.py from plugins/RPGRegions (it assumes that this is where it's running from because I'm a lazy dev).
